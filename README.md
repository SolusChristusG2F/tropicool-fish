The Tropicool Fish datapack seeks to add uses for the tropical fish while also implementing some small, simple mechanics to add a little more to the game than just another cooked fish (although it *does* add another cooked fish).

This repository contains the project's source code. The datapack can be downloaded from the Modrinth page:

## The Tropical Fish

This pack adds multiple different foods that ultimately stem from the Tropical Fish. 

These foods are:
- The Cooked Tropical Fish, **obtained by cooking the Tropical Fish in any Smoker, Furnace, or Campfire**,
- The Raw Fish Fillet, **obtained by combining the Tropical Fish and Fillet Knife in any crafting interface**,
- The Cooked Fish Fillet, **obtained by cooking the Raw Fish Fillet in any Smoker, Furnace, or Campfire**,
- Boiled Rice, **obtained by throwing Rice Grains into a water cauldron placed on top of a campfire**, and
- The Sushi Roll, **obtained by crafting using 1 Raw Fish Fillet, 6 Dried Kelp, and 2 Boiled Rice**.

## Tools

**This pack adds two new tools to the game: the Sickle and Fillet Knife.**

<br>

The Sickle is crafted using one Stick and 3 Iron Ingots as shown below:

When used to harvest Wheat, there is a 10% chance that the player will recieve Rice Grains. 

When used to mine any block that a Hoe can mine (such as Hay Bales), it will get the job done faster, but at a high cost of durability. It has sweep-hitting capabilities, but does not deal much damage.

Rice Grains can be thrown into a water-filled Cauldron placed on top of a Campfire, which will grant the player Boiled Rice. This item can either be eaten itself as a food source, granting 5 points of nutrition and 6 points of saturation, or used in the recipe for the Sushi Roll. 

<br>

The Fillet Knife is crafted using one Stick and 1 Iron Ingot as shown below:

When used in a crafting interface with a Tropical Fish, it will fillet the Tropical Fish, crafting two Raw Fish Fillets. Raw Fish Fillets are not a great food source themselves, only granting 2 points of nutrition and 0.35 points of saturation, but when cooked, they grant 3 points of nutrition and 4 points of saturation.

## Recipes

This pack adds the recipe for a Sushi Roll, a food item granting 9 points of nutrition and 12 points of saturation. It can be crafted using 1 Raw Fish Fillet, 6 Dried Kelp, and 2 Boiled Rice, as shown below:
